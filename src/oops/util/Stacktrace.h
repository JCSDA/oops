/// @brief This is a basic backport of C++23's stacktrace feature.
/// @details This uses Boost instead of eckit's Backtrace code because
///   the eckit implementation has a lot of platform-specific code
///   and libstdc++-related code for symbol demangling that is more
///   generalized by Boost. Boost's stacktrace code also provides
///   line numbers whenever possible.
/// @returns A string with the current stacktrace.

/// @brief Print details of the exception stack.
/// @details This C++11 feature was added after eckit's Exception classes
///   were written. It is more general, as all of the JEDI-related exceptions
///   ultimately derive from std::exception, including the eckit-related ones.
/// @param e is the exception.
/// @param out is the output stream.
/// @param level denotes current depth in the stack. Used because unwind_exception_stack is a recursive function.
