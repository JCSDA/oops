/// \brief Observation locations.
///
/// OOPS uses observation locations when computing GeoVaLs (model variables interpolated at
/// observation locations).
///
/// In general, observation locations, i.e. the regions of space probed by individual observations,
/// may have complex geometry. To compute GeoVaLs or ObsDiagnostics, OOPS does not need to know
/// that geometry exactly. Instead, the observation locations need to be discretized by sampling
/// them with a set of interpolation paths (1D rays along which the model fields will be
/// interpolated). Currently these paths must be vertical, but there are plans to add support for
/// slanted paths in the future. Different sampling methods may be used for different variables:
/// for instance, for rapidly varying variables each location may need to be sampled with multiple
/// interpolation paths, whereas for variables varying more slowly a single path per location may
/// be enough. The set of paths produced by each sampling method is represented by a
/// SampledLocations object. The Locations class stores one or more such objects and maps each
/// variable to one of them.
